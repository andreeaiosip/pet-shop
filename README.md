###### Task A Answer

**About the company:** 

Paws for Thought Pet Store in business for over 15 years and all their clients are recurrent customers or coming from word of mouth promotion. There is no online presence, except for a Facebook page which is in infancy and not very engaging. 

The goals of this website are:
• Promote their shop and their products online; 
• Attracting customers to visit their shop; 

The shop needs a simple static 5 pages website, to highlight the following:
- 10 categories of products they offer and to show the best seller in each category;
 - Services they offer: Grooming, Boarding and Dietician & Nutrition; 
 -  A brief history of the company and profiles of the team members; 
 - A video and images about the shop, products and services they offer;
 -  Display a link to their Facebook page, so the customers can stay engaged and keep and eye on any updates; 
 -  Location and address of the shop;
 -  Contact details: email address and phone number; 
 -  Opening hours; 

Considering the budget and time constraints, there will be no e-commerce function implemented. However, for an easy access and communication, the customers can click on a product and service to link to an automatic email completed with the details of the product/service they are interested in.
